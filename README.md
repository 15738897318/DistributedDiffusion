# DistributedDiffusion

This repository contains a partial implementation of the system design and algorithm presented in:

**Exploring Collaborative Distributed Diffusion-Based AI-Generated Content (AIGC) in Wireless Networks**

Please note that only the main function (offloading.py) is currently open-sourced. We will immediately release the complete implementation once our paper has been accepted.
